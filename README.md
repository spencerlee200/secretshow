  Technologies Used: Angular, firebase, HTML5, and CSS3

  For this project I worked with one of my classmates to create a website for a friend in Full Sail's film project. He wanted a static web page where people could watch the pilot to his tv show so we gave him that plus a little more flair. This was really fun because it was my first experience working with a client. You can see it live [here](https://spencerlee200.github.io/secretshow/).
